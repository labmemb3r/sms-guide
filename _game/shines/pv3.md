# Pianta 3
In this episode, Mario must reclaim FLUDD and rescue the mayor of Pianta Village, all while the level is coated in lava-like goop. This section will be broken down into four steps:
(i) Setting up for the damage boost
(ii) Damage boosting across the lava
(iii) Crossing the mushrooms to FLUDD
(iv) Obtaining FLUDD and finishing the level
Appendices are provided containing damageless strats, for new players that are uncomfortable with i-frames as well as bingo players, the latter of which may encounter "Pianta 3 damageless" as a square on their board.

## Step 1: Setting up for the damage boost
Cross the wooden bridge using a series of jump dives and rollouts. As Mario crosses the bridge, he will gain the attention of three Wind Spirits.

Next, position Mario at the edge of the goop. Be careful not to bonk into any Piantas or the fence at the other side of the bridge.

The timing for this step is important, as we would like to use the Wind Spirits to hit Mario and obtain i-frames in Step 2.

## Step 2: Damage boosting across the lava
The objective is for Mario to take damage from an enemy, and to use the i-frames (i for "invincibility") to safely cross the lava and make it to safe ground. There are two ways to do this:
(1) The ideal approach is for Mario to get hit from behind by one of the Wind Spirits that spawned near the bridge.

(2) If no Wind Spirits are left to hit Mario, you can have Mario get hit by one of the Goomies that spawn in the goop.

Once Mario has taken damage, you now have a short time window to cross the lava. The safest method is to dive-rollout into a spin jump onto the mushroom highlighted in the figure below:

Make sure to spin the analogue stick during the rollout animation so that the spin jump is ready to go once Mario finishes rolling out.

## Step 3: Crossing the mushrooms to FLUDD
FLUDD is located at the top of the wooden structure in the middle of the goop, shown here:
(insert figure here)
To get there, the best approach is to spin jump across the mushrooms. Make sure to ground pound above each mushroom while in the spin jump animation, otherwise Mario will start sliding upon touching the ground.
For the last mushroom, instead of ground pounding, you can rollout off the mushroom onto the wooden structure.
